Project: Improving Friendly Error Messages 
Student: Will Rabalais
Mentors: [Sam Pottinger](https://github.com/sampottinger) & [Raphaël de Courville](https://github.com/SableRaf)  
Organization: [Processing](https://github.com/processing/processing)

Project Overview
---
The Friendly Error Messages for Processing project aimed to improve the way error messages are displayed to users, enhancing the debugging experience by providing concise yet informative error messages with context, external resources and line numbers when possible. The project is an addition to the existing Processing error message system, adding more extensive error messages so that it resembles the [P5.js Friendly Error System (FES)](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/main/contributor_docs/friendly_error_system.md). The challenge was that error messages generated by the compiler and the Java Virtual Machine are often vague, full of jargon and inaccessible to new programmers. The primary objective was to explain the error while and presenting the underlying cause in a manner more beginner friendly. Moreover, these revamped error messages featured direct links to relevant documentation for a deeper understanding of the issues. <br>

Features Added
---
- Simplified Error Messages: The existing error messages were often cryptic and challenging to understand for new developers. This project simplified the error messages by breaking them down into digestible components while retaining the necessary technical information. These error messages are accessible when an error is triggered via a new button (ℹ️) as seen below.
- Contextual Information: Alongside the error message itself, the enhanced popup displayed additional contextual information, such as the relevant code snippet, variable values, or function call stack. This contextual data aimed to provide developers with a clearer understanding of the error's origin.
- Improvements to the debugger: https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/729 (and https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/692)
- External Links: The enhanced error message included external links to relevant [Processing Reference](https://processing.org/reference/) documentation, tutorials, or community discussions, assisting developers in troubleshooting and resolving issues efficiently.<br>

Libraries Used
---
- [Flexmark Library](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java): Flexmark is a Java library used for parsing and rendering Markdown content. In this project, Flexmark was employed to convert markdown-formatted error descriptions into HTML for rendering within the popup.
- [StringTemplate Library](https://www.stringtemplate.org/): StringTemplate is a template engine that allows for dynamic generation of textual output. It was used to create error message templates capable of incorporating specific statements from the code that likely caused the error and line numbers.
- [Ant](https://ant.apache.org): Indirectly used, part of Processing's build system.
- [Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/swing/): Used to extend the Processing Development Environment.<br>

What’s Left to Improve
---
- Originally we had aimed to include features such as a translation engine that for the friendly errors and an error log however due to time constraints these were not implemented. 
- Expand test coverage
- Verify language server support

What I Personally Learned
---
The biggest challenge for me was experiencing a large codebase for the first time. I found that it required a different mindset than a smaller project does. I was also exposed to new libraries, design patterns and development practices. Working collaboratively with tools such as Git was also relatively new to me and I believe that learning in collaborative environment in which people depended on me I learned quicker than I would have on my own.
